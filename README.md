# World_Development_Indicators
Indicators influencing Economic Development across the world 
an open dataset from Kaggle. It is The World Development Indicators dataset obtained from the World Bank containing over
a thousand annual indicators of economic development from hundreds of countries around the world. 
Used matplotlib , pandas to perform the data analysis.

Please download the dataset from the above link as github did not let me upload a file larger than 25mb.
Since I chose to do US data , I have provided a csv file containing only the Us data ,But to fully understand the magnitude of this data. I recommend downloading the fll data set.
Some functions like the Unique country name and unique country codes may not return the same values in the small csv file like the original data.Apart from this the code should work perfectly fine.
